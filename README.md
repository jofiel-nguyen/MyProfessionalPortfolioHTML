Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Thi Tu Nhu Nguyen, but you can call me "Wren." Thank you for taking the time to visit my website.

I have a diverse range of experience and education, starting with over three years of working as a pharmacy technician at CVS Pharmacy. During this time, I developed strong organizational and communication skills, as well as a keen attention to detail.

In addition to my work in the pharmacy industry, I also have a background in research science. I worked at the Vietnam Academy of Science and Technology, where I learned valuable skills such as data analysis and research methodology.

To further expand my skill set, I pursued additional education in information technology. I completed a full-stack developer boot camp at Rice University and also took the highly-regarded CS50 course offered by Harvard University. Through these programs, I gained proficiency in programming languages such as Java, Python, and JavaScript, as well as in front-end and back-end web development.

I hold an associate of science degree from Lonestar College with a GPA of 3.7. Additionally, I was recognized for my achievements with graduation honors in pharmacy technician from Ashworth College, where I also earned certification in the field.

Overall, I am a highly skilled and passionate professional who is ready to take on new challenges and achieve great things. Thank you for considering me for any opportunities that may arise.
